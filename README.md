1. Time Series Data Preparation

* Reads weather data with dates as the index, recognizing it's temporal (time-based).
* Treats missing data carefully by analyzing null patterns and forward-filling when appropriate.
* Filters out unreliable columns (with too many missing values) to ensure model integrity.

2. Index Handling & Time Features

* Converts the index to datetime to unlock powerful time-based functionality.
* Extracts features like year, month, and day-of-year — crucial for time series seasonality analysis.

3. Feature Engineering for Forecasting

* Constructs a **forecasting target** by shifting the temperature data forward — predicting tomorrow using today’s data.
* Adds **rolling averages** to capture short-term trends and momentum in temperature and precipitation.
* Introduces **percent change** in rolling features — highlighting trend direction and volatility.
* Computes **seasonal averages** (monthly & day-of-year) using expanding window statistics to reflect cumulative climate behavior over time.

4. Machine Learning on Time Series

* Implements **Ridge Regression**, a linear model that adds regularization to prevent overfitting.
* Excludes non-predictive or leakage-prone columns (`target`, `station`, `name`) from the input features.

5. Backtesting: Simulated Real-World Forecasting

* Defines a custom **backtesting loop**: simulates how a model would perform in production by iteratively training on historical data and testing on the future.
* Ensures **temporal integrity** (i.e., never trains on future data).
* Stores prediction results and evaluates both accuracy and magnitude of error.

---

6. Model Evaluation and Interpretation

* Uses **mean absolute error (MAE)** to measure forecast accuracy — a common metric in regression problems.
* Explores **distribution of prediction error** over time to identify model behavior and reliability.
* Sorts and filters high-error days to better understand when the model struggles (e.g., extreme weather events).

7. Visualization for Insight

* Plots weather metrics (e.g., snow depth) and prediction error frequencies — essential for communicating patterns, anomalies, or performance degradation visually.

8. Key Modeling Principles Reinforced

* Importance of **data quality filtering** before modeling.
* Use of **time-aware features** like lag, rolling stats, and expanding averages for better temporal modeling.
* Practice of **modular thinking** (via reusable functions like `backtest()` and `compute_rolling()`).
* Insight into the **limitations of simple models** and when additional complexity might be warranted (e.g., nonlinear models, exogenous variables).
